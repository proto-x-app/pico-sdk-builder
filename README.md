## Opening Scene: Jeorge's Morning Briefing

Good morning, future developers! Jeorge Getson here, ready to rocket you through the stars with our brand-new `pico-w-base` project. But first, a message from my boss, Mr. Spacely.

**Mr. Spacely**: Jeorge! What's the big idea with this `pico-w-base` thingamajig?

## Act 1: Mr. Spacely's Grand Vision

**Mr. Spacely**: Listen up, Jeorge. We at Spacely's Space Sprockets are always ahead of the curve. I want this `pico-w-base` to be the future! The future, I tell you!

**Jeorge**: You got it, boss! Our `pico-w-base` is a web-enabled firmware deployment system. Imagine, deploying firmware as easily as pushing a button!

## Act 2: Spacely's Sprockets in Cyberspace!

**Jeorge**: To get started, you'll need to set up Docker. Remember, in the future, Docker isn't just a hobby; it's a way of life.

1. Install Docker
2. Run `docker-compose up`

**Mr. Spacely**: I don't have time for details, Jeorge! Make it snappy!

## Act 3: Push the Button, Jeorge!

**Jeorge**: With our GitHub Actions, every push is like a rocket launch, straight to production!

1. Set up GitHub Actions
2. Push the button!

**Mr. Spacely**: Jeorge, you better make sure this works, or you're fired!

## Closing Remarks: Another Day Saved

**Jeorge**: And there you have it, folks! With `pico-w-base`, you're not just deploying firmware; you're making history!

**Mr. Spacely**: As long as it makes money, Jeorge, that's what counts!
